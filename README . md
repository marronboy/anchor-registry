# ANCHOR

**ANCHOR** is a public registry for the security state of blockchain addresses.

ANCHOR does not move funds.  
ANCHOR does not rate or judge addresses.  
ANCHOR only records cryptographically verifiable declarations and their history.

## What problem does ANCHOR solve?

Blockchains show balances and transactions,  
but they do **not** show how an address is managed.

Today, you cannot publicly verify:
- which cryptographic algorithm an address claims to use
- whether keys have been rotated
- whether an address has been revoked
- whether the owner is actively maintaining the key

ANCHOR makes this information **public, verifiable, and auditable**.

## What ANCHOR is (and is not)

### ANCHOR **is**
- a public address security state registry
- non-custodial (keys never leave wallets)
- chain-neutral (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- minimal by design

### ANCHOR **is not**
- a payment network
- a wallet
- a rating or certification system
- a security guarantee

---

## Core principle

> **Do not trust ANCHOR.  
Verify what address owners declare.**

---

## Status

ANCHOR is an early-stage open specification and reference implementation.
